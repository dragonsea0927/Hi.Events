# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Hi.Events, we take the security of our software seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we would appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.

### Urgent Issues

For urgent security issues, please email us directly at [security@hi.events](mailto:security@hi.events). This will ensure that your report is promptly received and reviewed by our security team.

### Non-Urgent Issues

For non-urgent security issues, please create an issue in our GitHub repository using the following link: [https://github.com/HiEventsDev/hi.events/issues](https://github.com/HiEventsDev/hi.events/issues). Please ensure that the issue is labeled appropriately to indicate that it is a security concern.

## Security Update Policy

- We aim to respond to initial reports within 48 hours.
- We will provide an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
- We will notify the reporter when the vulnerability has been addressed.

## Best Practices for Reporting

When reporting a security issue, please include as much of the following information as possible to help us better understand the nature and scope of the issue:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue, including any relevant code snippets or screenshots.
- Any potential mitigations or workarounds that might be applicable.
- Your contact information for any follow-up questions.
- The version of the software you are using.
- Any other relevant information that might help us understand the issue

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We believe in responsible disclosure and are committed to working with the security community to verify, reproduce, and respond to all legitimate reports. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and practitioners who help make the open-source ecosystem a safer place.
